# Electronic-Systems-Design
A collection of slides, personal notes covering 'Electronic Systems Design' methodologies and ecosystem. The depth of material is akin to a ‘motivational’ or ‘101’ lecture given in relevant EE/CE courses. Limited to my knowledge and experience gained in the past 4.5 years :)

#### What is covered?
* Economics of Electronic Systems Design (ESD)
    * Understand various market players - EDA/IP, fabless, fablite, foundry etc.
* Introduction to basics of Electronics Systems Design Methodology
    * VLSI design methodologies – Digital, Analog and Mixed-Signal
    * Various EDA tools involved in the design process
    * ‘Hardware-Software Co-design’ using ‘Platform SoCs’ or ‘MpSoC’s’
 
#### What is not covered?
* Transistors, semiconductor physics etc. deliberately left out to focus on higher levels of abstraction
* Memory design will be included in future revisions
* Analog design (the presenter is a ‘Software Engineer’ who writes C++ but knows a bit of DFT/ATPG)
* Advanced topics in Physical Design and Implementation – beyond author’s level of expertise

#### Why? Who is the target audience?
* ‘Software Engineers’ interested to learn more about VLSI and chip design flow
* Many want to learn about different EDA tools and how they fit in the overall design flow
* Stuff you don’t learn in EE/ECE/CE curriculum but are expected to pick up on your own
* Clarify basic terminology and three-four letter acronyms - VLSI, ASIC, ASSP, SoC etc.
* Provide pointers and useful references for those looking for more

#### How can you use it?
* Offer a 101 type lecture to interns, fresh graduates etc. joining any organization involved with semiconductor design, electronic systems, EDA etc.
* If you want to offer a short 1h lecture to non-engineers and introduce them to Electronic Systems
* If you want to have a rich set of illustrations, flow charts, diagrams you want to use in your slides.
